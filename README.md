## Motivation

As one of the goal of my next year is learning C to understand low level stuff.
I saw there are a lof people participating in advent of code and have some fun.
So, why not joining them?

I haven't decide to include the test for this yet, I don't like using specific lib for testing.
Maybe I'll exporting all the function using header files later. Who knows?

## Example how to run the program

move to specific day inside 202x dir

```
cd 2023/day1
```

compile the code using clang or gcc

```
$ clang -g trebuchet.c

```

run the program

```
$ ./a.out
```
