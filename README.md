## Motivation

As one of the my goal next year(2024) is learning C to understand low level stuff, especially to jump in to interesting topic such as database (distributed) and linux kernel. A lot of existing system are using C/C++ for the implementation. Understanting C in and out is very important to understand these topics.
I'm not going to dive to C++, because my long term memory couldn't handle features it brought to the table. I prefer simple a simple language.

C is an old language, third generation of programming language, and the use case is almost everywhere.
IMO, learning C and have good understanding how modern computer works will benefit me.

There are a lof people participating in advent of code to have some fun, especially learn a new language.
Initially, I was going to learn Go and Rust. Unfortunately, I may never appreciate Rust before I struggle with "unsafe memory" management.

## Example how to run the program

move to specific day inside 202x dir

```
cd 2023/day1
```

compile the code using clang or gcc

```
clang -g trebuchet.c

```

run the program

```
./a.out
```

I haven't decide to include the test at the moment, I don't like using specific lib for testing.
Maybe I'll exporting all the function using header files later. Who knows?
